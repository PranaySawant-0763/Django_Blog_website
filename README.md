Django Blog Website is a full-stack web application built using Python and Django, where users can create, view, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
The application includes a secure authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their content easily.
The project is built using Django’s MVT (Model–View–Template) architecture, making it organized, scalable, and easy to maintain. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while the backend handles business logic, routing, database operations, and user authentication.
